# Zero-Shot-Named-Entity-Recognition-with-Transformer-Models
Jupyter notebook for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a zero-shot learning approach with state-of-the-art transformer-based language models.



This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using **zero-shot learning** with transformer-based models, such as those available on Hugging Face ðŸ¤—.

Rather than training a model with labeled entity data, we leverage zero-shot capabilities to identify custom entities in text using natural language prompts.
